<p><em>Learn ConTeXt</em> is an introduction to <a href="http://contextgarden.net">ConTeXt</a>. ConTeXt is a document typesetting system. It generates high–quality PDF documents from source files with typographic commands.</p>

<p>The subtitle refers to a broader subject. The book is <em>An Introduction to Digital Typography</em> to the extend it explains ConTeXt. The book deals with digital typography, but this isn’t its main point. Digital typography is explained only as required by the explanation of ConTeXt.</p>

<h2>
<a id="download" class="anchor" href="#download" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Download</h2>

<p>The book is only in its early stages. It is a very rough draft. It needs composition and polishing. I’m afraid that I don’t have time enough to write faster.</p>

<p>I hope to upload a draft version with the complete table of contents as soon as possible. Of course, text will be missing in that early version.</p>

<p>It you find any flaw or you have something to comment, please <a href="https://github.com/ousia/learn-context/issues/new">open an issue</a>.</p>
