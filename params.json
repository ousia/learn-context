  "body": "# Learn ConTeXt\r\n\r\n_Learn ConTeXt_ is an introduction to [ConTeXt](http://contextgarden.net). ConTeXt is a document typesetting system. It generates high–quality PDF documents from source files with typographic commands.\r\n\r\nThe subtitle refers to a broader subject. The book is _An Introduction to Digital Typography_ to the extend it explains ConTeXt. The book deals with digital typography, but this isn’t its main point. Digital typography is explained only as required by the explanation of ConTeXt.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThe book is only in its early stages. It is a very rough draft. It needs composition and polishing. I’m afraid that I don’t have time enough to write faster.\r\n\r\nI hope to upload a draft version with the complete table of contents as soon as possible. Of course, text will be missing in that early version.\r\n\r\nIt you find any flaw or you have something to comment, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ousia/learn-context/issues/new).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n_Learn ConTeXt_ may be downloaded by anyone (see [Licensing] below). This follows a simple purpose: to give an introduction to ConTeXt to anyone willing to learn.\r\n\r\nThere is a deal in what may be considered a noble persons’ agreement:\r\n\r\n* If you think the book is worth it, please share the address  <http://www.learn-context.tk> which anyone you think it may interest her.\r\n\r\n* If you think the book contains errors or you have improvement suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ousia/learn-context/issues/new). Don’t forget to tell what I am missing and what should be improved.\r\n\r\n* If your think the book doesn’t even reach the lowest standards, I’m thankful for the criticism. It would be helpful, when criticism contains reasons. In any case, always be respectful to people.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\n_Learn ConTeXt_ is released to the public for download exclusively from this website.
